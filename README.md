A CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) calculator project using JavaScript is a web-based application that helps students calculate their cumulative GPA based on the grades they have received in their courses. This project typically involves creating a user-friendly web interface where students can input their course details, including course names, credit hours, and grades. JavaScript is used to perform the calculations, including converting letter grades to numeric values, calculating the GPA for each course, and then computing the cumulative GPA by averaging the individual course GPAs. The result is displayed to the user, providing them with a quick and convenient way to track and manage their academic performance. This project demonstrates how JavaScript can be used for practical applications, making academic tasks more accessible and efficient for students.
